        <p>My name is Philip. I am a male who is currently 18 years old. I was born in Australia but my parents are from Hong Kong. I have an older brother and a younger sister who are also studying university online.</p>
        
        <p>I was born in Churchill, Gippsland, which is in the more rural parts of Victoria. While I donâ€™t have many memories of the place, it was a small town that had a lot of open fields and cows. I attended Hazelwood North Primary school up to Grade 1, after which I was homeschooled. We moved to Wantirna South in Melbourne when I was 7.</p> 

        <p>Me and my sister would go biking around the suburb a lot. It was enclosed and only had one entrance that led to an open road so we usually rode up to the dead end in the road and back. Sometimes our dad would accompany us to ride to the park.</p>
